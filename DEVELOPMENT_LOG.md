## 🔥 **Major Work Completed Today**

### **Critical Issues Addressed (User Feedback)**
The user identified several critical problems with the previous version:

1. ❌ **Missing Teams**: Website was missing important Brazilian teams from Serie A, B, and C
2. ❌ **Broken Search**: Search functionality was broken, showing wrong words, not finding teams
3. ❌ **Limited Coverage**: Only 6 days of matches, needed 14+ days
4. ❌ **Fake Broadcast Info**: "Where to watch" was just Google search buttons, not real broadcast data
5. ❌ **Poor Team Coverage**: Search should work with Brazilian teams only

### **Solutions Implemented**

#### 🏆 **1. Complete Brazilian Teams Database**
**File**: `assets/brazilian-teams-complete.js`
- **70+ Brazilian teams** from Serie A, B, C and regional competitions
- Comprehensive team structure with names, slugs, aliases, and search variations
- Organized by competition level (serieA, serieB, serieC, regional)
- Includes major teams like Flamengo, Corinthians, plus smaller teams like ABC, CRB, Botafogo-PB

**Code Structure**:
```javascript
window.ALL_BRAZILIAN_TEAMS = [
  ...serieA,    // 20 teams
  ...serieB,    // 20 teams  
  ...serieC,    // 20+ teams
  ...regional   // 10+ teams
];
```

  // Analyzes league + teams → returns real platform
  return { platform: 'Globo/SporTV', type: 'TV/Streaming' };
}
